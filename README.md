URL Shortener 

Overview
The URL Shortener App is a simple yet useful tool built with React that allows users to shorten long URLs using the TinyURL API. The app provides an intuitive and responsive UI, allowing users to enter a URL, generate a shortened version, and copy it with ease.

Features
✅ User-Friendly Interface – A clean and minimalistic UI with a text input, button, and result display.
✅ URL Shortening – Takes a long URL as input and generates a shortened version using the TinyURL API.
✅ Copy to Clipboard – Allows users to copy the shortened URL with a single click.
✅ Error Handling – Displays appropriate error messages when input is invalid or if the API request fails.
✅ Responsive Design – Works seamlessly on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
✅ Loading State – Provides feedback when the URL is being shortened.

Technologies Used
React.js – Frontend framework for building the UI.
TinyURL API – External API for URL shortening.
CSS – Used for styling with responsiveness and button hover effects.
JavaScript (ES6) – Handles user input, API calls, and state management.

How It Works
          The user enters a long URL in the input field.
          Clicking the "Shorten URL" button triggers an API request to TinyURL.
          The shortened URL is displayed below the button.
          The user can click the link to open the shortened URL in a new tab.
          A "Copy" button allows users to copy the shortened link to their clipboard.
